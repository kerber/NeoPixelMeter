NeoPixelMeter
=============

An Arduino library meant to power chained NeoPixels as meter gauges

It was designed and tested with Adafruit's NeoPixel Ring - 16, though it should work with larger NeoPixel rings, sticks, and strips.

I 3D printed a housing with translucent PLA to fit around the base of the taps on my keg fridge.
